# Executive Summary

The IS2020 report is the latest in a series of model curricula recommendations and guidelines for
undergraduate degrees in Information Systems (IS). The report builds on the foundations
developed in previous model curricula reports to develop a major revision of the model curriculum
with the inclusion of significant new characteristics. Specifically, the IS2020 report does not
directly prescribe a degree structure that targets a specific context or environment. Rather, the
IS2020 report provides guidance regarding the core content of the curriculum that should be
present but also provides flexibility to customize curricula according to local institutional needs.

The foundations of curriculum guidelines for the IS discipline emerged in the 1950s. Since then,
the discipline evolved to express simultaneous interest in the design of data structures and
applications and the deployment of these artifacts within various organizational domains of use.
Typical educational contexts for IS undergraduate programs are business schools, computing
schools and schools of information management. However, the expansion of digital technologies
across the societal spectrum has led also to other disciplinary variations that are tantamount to
IS program contexts. With a balanced combination of IS competencies, domain-specific
competencies, and individual foundational competencies, this report is intended to facilitate the
development of graduates that are well prepared for jobs that require the design and management
of technical solutions for usersâ€™ organizational, societal, and disciplinary needs of computing.
Typical job titles for graduates are IT Consultant, Data Analyst, Computer Systems Analyst, IT
Auditor, Software Applications Developer, and Information Security Analyst (Mandviwalla et al.,
2019).
